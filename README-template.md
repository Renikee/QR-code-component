## My process
I used Figma to get the measurements needed in the design.
Worked on the HTML structure and styled it with CSS.

### Built with

### What I learned

I learnt how to use Figma and how to import font from Google fonts into a stylesheet.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
